Vanilla Fishing Expanded is a first module in a brand new mod series “Vanilla Cuisine Expanded” from the Vanilla Expanded team. With such an important mechanic missing from the base game, we Oskar and Sarg have decided to introduce a way to catch fish in your local water sources, adding a bit of purpose for settling near running water and ocean side.

With simple, intuitive, vanilla-like mechanics, all it takes is to designate a fishing zone same way you designate a growing zone, and assign your Animals capable pawns to the new fishing job type. In no time they will pull out fishing rods from their invisible bags, head straight down to the river and whilst chatting to each other, try to catch a new meat type called fish, which can be eaten raw (providing an Ate raw food debuff, just like regular vanilla meat), or used in a cooking recipe. Unlike other mods, the fish don’t need to be butchered.
